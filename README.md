# Churn-Predictor-Using-Neuro-Symbolic-Artificial-Intelligence
 This project predicts customer churn using Neuro-Symbolic Machine Learning, which combines neural networks and symbolic logic. It uses the Telco Customer Churn dataset to identify patterns and explain why a customer may leave, making predictions more accurate and understandable.
